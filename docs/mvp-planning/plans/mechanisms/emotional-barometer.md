## Purpose

Monitor emotional intensity throughout the process and offer support options when intensity is high. The approach is choice-based—users decide what helps them regulate, whether that's continuing to share (which can be cathartic) or trying a grounding exercise.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Session[User in session] --> Periodic[Periodic check-in]
    Periodic --> Prompt[How intense are your feelings right now?]
    Prompt --> Rate[User rates 1-10]

    Rate --> Evaluate{Intensity level}
    Evaluate -->|1-4| Calm[Calm zone]
    Evaluate -->|5-7| Elevated[Elevated zone]
    Evaluate -->|8-10| High[High intensity zone]

    Calm --> Continue[Continue normally]
    Elevated --> Monitor[Monitor more frequently]
    High --> Offer[Offer support options]

    Monitor --> Trend{Trending up?}
    Trend -->|No| Continue
    Trend -->|Yes| Offer

    Offer --> Choice{User chooses}
    Choice -->|Keep sharing| Continue
    Choice -->|Try exercise| Exercise[Grounding exercise overlay]
    Choice -->|Take break| Break[End session for now]

    Exercise --> Recheck[Check in after exercise]
    Recheck --> BreakOrContinue{Break or keep going?}
    BreakOrContinue -->|Keep going| Continue
    BreakOrContinue -->|Take break| Break
```

## Intensity Zones

| Rating | Zone | AI Behavior |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1-4 | Calm | Normal pace; occasional check-ins |
| 5-7 | Elevated | More frequent check-ins; watch for trends |
| 8-10 | High | Offer support options; user chooses path |

## Offering Support

When intensity is high, the AI offers options conversationally:

```
AI: "I can feel how intense this is. A few paths from here—
     you can keep sharing if getting it out is helping,
     try a breathing exercise to settle your body,
     or take a break and come back later.
     What feels right?"
```

The user chooses. No advancement is disabled; no mandatory cooling period. Trust the user to know what they need.

## Support Options Flow

When the user chooses to try an exercise, it appears as an overlay:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Offer[AI offers support options] --> Choice{User chooses}

    Choice -->|Keep sharing| Continue[Continue conversation]
    Choice -->|Breathing exercise| Overlay[Exercise overlay appears]
    Choice -->|Take a break| Break[Session ends for now]

    Overlay --> Grey[Chat greys out behind]
    Grey --> Exercise[User completes exercise]
    Exercise --> Checkin[How are you feeling now?]
    Checkin --> Ask[Break or keep going?]

    Ask -->|Keep going| Dismiss[Overlay disappears]
    Ask -->|Take a break| Break

    Dismiss --> Continue
```

Key points:
- Exercises navigate to a dedicated screen with easy "Back to chat" option
- Chat is preserved and restored when returning
- After exercise, user chooses next step—no gatekeeping
- "Keep sharing" is always a valid choice (writing can be cathartic)

## Wireframe: Emotional Barometer UI

```mermaid

    subgraph Compact[Compact View - In Chat Input]
        Label[How are you feeling?]
        Slider[1 --- 5 --- 10]
        Description[Calm ... Intense]
    end

    subgraph Overlay[Exercise Overlay - Over Greyed Chat]
        Title[Taking a Moment]
        Message[It makes sense to feel strongly about this]
        ExerciseContent[Breathing or grounding exercise]
        Checkin[How are you feeling now? 1-10]
        Choice[Take a break / Keep going]
    end
```

## Multi-Session Persistence

The barometer tracks patterns over time:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Session1[Session 1\nAvg: 6] --> Session2[Session 2\nAvg: 7]
    Session2 --> Session3[Session 3\nAvg: 5]
    Session3 --> Session4[Session 4\nAvg: 4]

    Session1 --> Trend[Trend Analysis]
    Session2 --> Trend
    Session3 --> Trend
    Session4 --> Trend

    Trend --> Insight[Emotions decreasing over time]
```

## Privacy of Emotional Data

- Ratings are **private by default**
- Stored in User Vessel only
- AI may ask consent to share if it helps:

```
AI: "I noticed you have been feeling quite intense during our
    conversations. Would it be helpful for [Partner] to know
    that this process brings up strong feelings for you?"
```

## Support Options

When intensity is high, the AI offers:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Keep sharing | Continue the conversation—writing can be cathartic |
| Breathing exercise | Guided 4-7-8 breathing or similar |
| Grounding exercise | 5-4-3-2-1 senses check with required text input at each step |
| Body scan | Brief check-in with physical sensations |
| Take a break | End session and return later |

Note: "Private journaling" is no longer a separate option—the user is already in a text conversation, so "keep sharing" serves this purpose.

**Grounding exercise design:** Each step of the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise requires the user to type their observations before proceeding (e.g., naming 5 things they can see). This ensures genuine engagement rather than clicking through. The input is not saved—the act of noticing and naming is what matters.

## Display Options

The barometer can be presented in two ways:

1. **Always visible** - A persistent slider at the bottom of the chat interface that users can adjust at any time
2. **Periodic popup** - The barometer appears as a gentle popup at key moments (stage transitions, after intense exchanges, or on a timer)

Either approach is valid. The always-visible option provides continuous awareness, while the popup approach can feel less intrusive and more intentional.

## Implementation Notes

- Check-ins should feel natural, not intrusive
- Frequency adapts to user pattern (more often if volatile)
- Never shame or judge high intensity ratings
- Support options are framed as choices, not requirements
- Trust users to know what helps them regulate
- Some people regulate by continuing to express—honor that
- Exercises navigate to a dedicated screen with easy back navigation
- Chat content is preserved and restored after exercises
